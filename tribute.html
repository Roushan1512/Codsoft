        Matthew Langford Perry (August 19, 1969 - October 28, 2023) was an American and Canadian actor. He starred as Chandler Bing on the NBC television sitcom Friends from 1994 to 2004, and won a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series for the role. Perry also appeared on Ally McBeal (2002) and received Primetime Emmy Award nominations for his performances in The West Wing (2003) and The Ron Clark Story (2006). He gained a leading role in the NBC series Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip which aired from 2006 to 2007. Perry also became known for his leading film roles in Fools Rush In (1997), Almost Heroes (1998), Three to Tango (1999), The Whole Nine Yards (2000), Serving Sara (2002), The Whole Ten Yards (2005), and 17 Again (2009). He voiced Benny in the video game Fallout: New Vegas (2010).
        <br>Perry was born in Williamstown, Massachusetts, on August 19, 1969. His mother, Suzanne Marie Morrison (n√©e Langford, born 1948), is a Canadian journalist who was press secretary to Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. His father, John Bennett Perry (born 1941), is an American actor and former model.
        <br>By age 10, Perry started misbehaving. He stole money, smoked, let his grades slip, and beat up Trudeau with another classmate in fifth grade. Perry began drinking alcohol at age 14 and was drinking alcohol every day by age 18. Perry practiced tennis, often for 10 hours per day, and became a top-ranked junior player in Canada with the possibility of a tennis career. However, at age 15, he moved from Ottawa to Los Angeles to live with his father and competition there was tougher.
        <br>Perry held Canadian and American citizenship. He dated Yasmine Bleeth in 1995, Julia Roberts from 1995 to 1996, and Lizzy Caplan from 2006 to 2012. In November 2020, Perry became engaged to literary manager Molly Hurwitz, with their engagement ending in 2021.
        <br>In 2009, Perry was a guest on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, where he presented Ellen DeGeneres with an Xbox 360 and a copy of Fallout 3. The gesture led to game studio Obsidian Entertainment casting him in Fallout: New Vegas as the voice of Benny.
        <br>Perry held various properties in Los Angeles County, including a condo in Sierra Towers purchased from Elton John, houses in Hollywood Hills and Malibu, and a cottage in Pacific Palisades. In 2017, Perry purchased a condo occupying the top floor of The Century in Los Angeles for $20 million. He sold it to Nick Molnar for $21.6 million in 2021, who sold it to Rihanna in 2023. In June 2023, Perry purchased a mid-century modern house in Hollywood Hills.
